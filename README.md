# Koop Provider for SMART Connect
This Koop (https://github.com/koopjs/koop) provider is designed for use with the WCS Smart Connect Platform to leverage the data from the system to be displayed in Geoservices (http://geoservices.github.io/) web specifactions.

This app relies on a connection to the Smart Connection server for more information see (https://app.assembla.com/spaces/smart-cs/wiki/SMART_Connect)

## Linking SMART Connect Queries with Service endpoints using Mappings
The queries created in SMART connect can be used to create REST endpoints to query the data.  Using the types.js file under mappings we can create user friendly names for the Service endpoints.

| Service Name | UUID | Feature Service |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  carnivore | 'd1eb8f59-6135-4d45-9b69-1945cabf4af2' | http://localhost:8080/carnivore/FeatureServer/0 |

## Generate a Token for SMART Connect
To work with your services in SMART you will need to provide a token to the system for authentication.  For information on generating the token see:  https://app.assembla.com/spaces/smart-cs/wiki/SMART_Connect_API_Documentation
This token is added to the model.js file as the basic variable.

## Using the ArcGIS Online System
The system relies on the GeoJSON services to be served up from the SMART Connect it does not currently work with Raster (Image) Data from SMART or Tabluar only outputs.
